vlcControl
==========

Small script to manage VLC player from python using the VLC web interface.

The main motivation for creating this quick script is because there is no way to delete the current playing file from your computer, hence, making it harder to manage your music.

The only current feature is the ability to remove the current playing file from your computer. Autohotkey file included. Error checking and additional features could be added.
